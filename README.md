![Screenshot 2025-01-26 131247](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f1456dd-3fa2-476a-93ec-7a6db253b71c)

Outdoorfun is a website designed to help outdoor enthusiasts easily discover and explore events in the areas of hiking and mud runs. In today's world, finding an event can quickly become overwhelmingâ€”first, you struggle to locate a suitable event, then algorithms flood your social media feed with endless suggestions, making it hard to keep track.

This platform was created to simplify your search by providing a centralized and clutter-free overview of relevant events. Whether you're looking for your next adventure or just curious about what's happening nearby, Outdoorfun makes it easy to browse, filter, and find events that match your interests.

# Design
## Color Choice
The design aims to evoke the natural and outdoor elements associated with hiking and mud runs:

- **Footer in green:** Represents grass at meeting points during events.
- **Main content in grayish brown:** Symbolizes the dust and mud encountered in outdoor adventures.
- **Header in blue:** Represents the sky, invoking a sense of openness and possibility.
- **Brand text in white:** Reflects the white clouds seen on a sunny day.

For text, buttons and links I used the **Grey Friends** color palette suggested by [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D8D4D1&sub=1)

[:arrow_up:](#top)
## Possible Future Features
1. Links to all organisers
   - As this project is for educational purposes, I have refrained from including too many links to external websites. However, for the best user experience, it is appropriate to link to each organiser.
2. Event Details
   - The enthusiastic athlete can choose their distance at almost every event. For mud runs, the number of obstacles changes in addition to the distance. However, due to time constraints, I have decided to postpone these details until later.
3. Data input via the front end
   - With Django, it is possible to provide an input form via the front end, which can be used by trusted users or the organisers themselves to add events to the list, for example. This can be regulated via permissions.
4. Automatic deletion of past events
   - To keep the overview clean, you could set that events are automatically deleted if they are in the past.

### Responsiveness
This page was created for larger screens. Thanks to the use of Bootstrap, the site is responsive. However, the organisers' logos had to be scaled down for small screens such as smartphones in order to retain the layout. This would have made the logo unrecognisable. On the other hand, the logo would have taken up too much space in its original size and distracted from the actual content. That's why I decided to do without the images in smartphone size and leave it at the Bootstrap settings with regard to the screen adjustments.

# Fixed Bugs
The code worked well until implementing Cloudinary for media storage.
The first error message encountered was: "Organiser name cannot be null."
Since all organisers listed had names, I suspected the issue might be related to the images. To troubleshoot, I added a custom display_image method to the Django admin panel. This method checks for the presence of an image, and by ensuring the image field was correctly handled, the error was resolved.

![Screenshot 2025-01-27 213426](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20d8b928-a9a8-40b2-95a7-7dcabdcaf76a)

Next, the default image was no longer shown. I found a quick fix for this in Slack.

[:arrow_up:](#top)
#### Known error
Throughout the code I use Organisator instead of organiser. It wasn't until I spoke to my facilitator Kay at a weekly stand-up session that I realised I had used the German word. As the site is aimed at a predominantly German audience and I was planning to translate the site into German after the course anyway, I decided to leave this mistake. In conversation with Kay, I also realised that native English speakers are still able to understand the basic idea.
