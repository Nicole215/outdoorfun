Outdoorfun is a website designed to help outdoor enthusiasts easily discover and explore events in the areas of hiking and mud runs. In today's world, finding an event can quickly become overwhelmingâ€”first, you struggle to locate a suitable event, then algorithms flood your social media feed with endless suggestions, making it hard to keep track.

This platform was created to simplify your search by providing a centralized and clutter-free overview of relevant events. Whether you're looking for your next adventure or just curious about what's happening nearby, Outdoorfun makes it easy to browse, filter, and find events that match your interests.

- **Footer in green:** Represents grass at meeting points during events.
- **Main content in grayish brown:** Symbolizes the dust and mud encountered in outdoor adventures.
- **Header in blue:** Represents the sky, invoking a sense of openness and possibility.
- **Brand text in white:** Reflects the white clouds seen on a sunny day.

For text, buttons and links I used the **Grey Friends** color palette suggested by [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D8D4D1&sub=1)
